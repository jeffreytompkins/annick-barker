						<div class="col-sm-8">
							<p>I have been a social worker for over 20 years and a mental health therapist for 14 of those years. I grew up in Baltimore and did my undergraduate and graduate studies at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania.</p>
							<p>After living and working in Philadelphia for a number of years, I moved back to Baltimore in 2001. I have a certificate in psychotherapy from the University of Maryland School of Social Work and worked for many years as therapist in a community mental health clinic. I am also certified in the advanced treatment of psychological trauma.</p>
							<p>I have had experience working with people from a range of cultural and social backgrounds. I have dual European and American citizenship and speak French proficiently. I am also a member of the <a href="http://www.interculturalcounseling.org/">Intercultural Counseling Connection’s clinician network</a>, a group that provides therapy to immigrants seeking asylum.</p>

					<h2>What Am I Like in Person?</h2>
					<p>My clients and coworkers say I’m warm and down-to-earth. They appreciate my intelligence, compassion and thoughtfulness.</p>
					<p>Studies show that feeling at ease with your therapist is a big part of what makes therapy work. Your therapist should feel familiar, not  distant or judgmental. My goal is to provide you with just that: a safe, comfortable place to talk about things that matter to you.</p>
