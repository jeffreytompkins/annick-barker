					<h1>Services & Fees</h1>
					<h2>Free Consultation</h2>
					<p>It’s important to feel comfortable with your therapist. For this reason, I offer a free 30 minute consultation to help you decide whether I am the right fit for you. Call or e-mail me to schedule a <span class="underline">free consultation</span> by phone or at my office.</p>
					<h2>Initial Assessment</h2>
					<p>If you decide to work with me, we’ll schedule an initial 90 minute Initial Assessment meeting, at my office. That meeting is focused on learning more about you and what brought you to therapy. We’ll also begin putting together a plan for therapy.  The fee for the initial assessment is $135.</p>
					<h2>Therapy Sessions</h2>
					<p>Following the assessment meeting, we’ll decide when and how often to meet.   Therapy sessions are 50 minutes long and are guided by a plan we develop together. Typically I meet with people once a week or every 2 weeks.  The fee for therapy sessions is $100.</p>
					<h2>Fees & Insurance</h2>
					<p>I do not participate in any insurance plans. However, many insurance companies reimburse their members for “out-of-network” providers.  If you decide to use insurance, I can provide you with the receipt of payment you need to get reimbursed.</p>
